GUIDE TO ADDING THE DISCORD BOT TO A DISCORD SERVER

[Link to add the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1233912257763872829&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Please note that the Discord bot must be online in order to function properly. The Discord bot will only go online when the bot owner runs the Java client on their device's terminal. Usually, Discord bots require some kind of platform services such as Heroku, a cloud application platform, or other services in order to keep their bots running at all times. However, we were unable to create an account on Heroku. If this bot requires testing, it would be best to contact us so we can run the client.
